 ##### Dear Friend! Automatic update OpenBullet2 was Disabled by me! If you update OpenBullet2 Ifself, you will `LOSE ALL` my modification! I will be updated, but not very fast! Do not worry about this! 
 
 ##### License agreement (Mini)!
1. You download and use my software as it is.
2. You agree `not to modify`, `distribute` or `re-sell` my ideas/programs/videos or parts of my softwares!
3. PROHIBITED TO PUBLISH OPENLY MY CONFIGS OR PARTS OF PROGRAMS. ALL PROGRAMS HAVE DIGITAL SIGNATURES AND YOUR WILL BE BLOCKED VERY FAST!
4. I **fully support you** in all matters related to my software (video help, training, support), except help in hacking portals or sites. I have right to refuse illegal actions!
5. The license is for a **minimum of 6 months**. If you regularly contact me or ask for help - the license is `automatically renewed for unlimited time` (until I close the program). If you do not ask for help or do not communicate with me for **6 months and more**, I consider that you are fine or you are `no longer interested` in my program, and I have the right to `deny you new keys or updates!`
6. I do **not support or update** very old programs or version that were purchased a couple of years ago. You personally get all the updates and you personally have to keep up with the updates regularly! 
7. Since I regularly receive requests for software download links, there will be `no more links!` When you pay, you get an email with a link. **THE LINK IS PERMANENT**. If you `LOSE it`, you will `lose access` to download folder! Everything is very clear!
8. I'm open to ideas/suggestions and dialogue!

##### How do I check for updates? - About - Update button! Check for updates 1 or 2 a month. If there is a critical update you will be notified at startup! 

Free distribution of this modification is prohibited! This is a private modification for shoppy subscribers only. If you bought it NOT in OFFICIAL store - you were cheated by cheater and you will not have updates and support.
