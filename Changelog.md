 ##### Dear Friend! Automatic update OpenBullet2 was disabled by me! If you update OpenBullet2 you will lose all functions and my plugin! There will be updates, but not fast! Do not worry about this!
 
 ##### License agreement!

1. You download and use my software as it is.
2. You agree `not to modify`, `distribute` or `re-sell` my ideas/programs/ or parts of my softwares!
3. I **fully support you** in all matters related to my software (video help, training, support), except help in hacking portals or sites. I have right to refuse illegal actions!
4. The license is for a **minimum of 6 months**. If you regularly contact me or ask for help - the license is `automatically renewed for unlimited time` (until I close the program). If you do not ask for help or do not communicate with me for **6 months and more**, I consider that you are fine or you are `no longer interested` in my program, and I have the right to `deny you new keys or updates!`
5. I do **not support or update** very old programs or version that were purchased a couple of years ago. You personally get all the updates and you personally have to keep up with the updates regularly!
6. Since I regularly receive requests for software download links, there will be `no more links!` When you pay, you get an email with a link. **THE LINK IS PERMANENT**. If you `LOSE it`, you will `lose access` to download folder! Everything is very clear!
