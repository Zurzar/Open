7. I do not change or replace the software you buy ERRORY. You must understand exactly, what you want when you purchase, or ask me by private message.
8. **I only sell all software for bitcoins**. I don't sell them for Paypal or Visa. If somewhere offer you to buy my software for Paypal, they are scammers.
9. Buying and paying for bitcoins is your own business. I can't advise you where it's more profitable to buy bitcoins or how to do it the easiest way!
10. Response time to personal messages is `1-3 days!` Please do **not hysterical** if I do not answer quickly! I may be traveling/sleeping or busy! If you are not happy with this - stay away from communication with me or from buying my programs! Please appreciate my time and your.
